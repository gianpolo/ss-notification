# Microservices Solution

This repository now contains multiple .NET 9 Web API microservices. `Notification.Api` and `Orders.Api` both use Dapr and SignalR for messaging. The projects are included in the `microservices.sln` solution file.

Open `microservices.sln` with Visual Studio 2022 or later to work with the services.
